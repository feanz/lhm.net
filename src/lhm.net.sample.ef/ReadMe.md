# Using Lhm with Entityframework Migrations

This is an example project that shows how to use lhm.net with an existing entitty framework migration framework.  Lhm just plugs int your standard EF migrations.  You need to setup the Lhm.net tool with the connection string to use.  This can be done in the the migrations Configuration class.

*Requirements*

Create a local DB database Lhm.Test.Ef

*Note*

Lhm migration archive tables are not cleaned up by this you will need to do that seperatly.
